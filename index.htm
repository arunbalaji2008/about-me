            I like having many hobbies and 
            I have many hobbies. I like to draw, paint, and I'm a cuber.<br>
            My pb is 1 min. I've another hobby which is coding. I've created many webpages and games.
            I know js and html and I'm learning css.

          <div class="image-description">
              This is a project which looks like a quiz form. I've given some riddles and you should find the correct answer
              of them. If you got the correct answers, then the Treasure will be unlocked. Coders can find the answer easily because
              the answers are linked with coding. I encourage others who doesn't know coding to find the answers too.
